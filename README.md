# Enum Helper
A simple and opinionated collections of PHP 8.1 enum helpers inspired by [archtechx/enums](https://github.com/archtechx/enums) and [BenSampo/laravel-enum](https://github.com/BenSampo/laravel-enum).

This package is framework agnostic, but has a translation functionality based on Laravel framework, but it can extend to use in other frameworks.
